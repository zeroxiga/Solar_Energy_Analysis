# Solar Energy Analysis
Due to falling technology price and availability of government subsidy, the use of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to generate electricity has become widespread among the households in Australia. However, its power output is often characterised by inconsistency and unreliability. Key environmental determinants that influence the power throughput of a solar photovoltaic system include geographic location, solar orientation, and weather condition, such as temperature and humidity, for the installation site. This study examined the effect of weather conditions, specifically temperature and relative humidity conditions, on the energy output of 16 residential solar PV systems installed in Northern Queensland. A linear regression model was fitted to assess the linearity of temperature, humidity and solar irradiance to PV energy produced. The results indicated that all three environmental variables explained 84.6% variability of PV energy produced during 2019. These findings could be used as a starting point of a more comprehensive PV performance modelling which would assist in refining the solar energy planning process that determines the suitability of solar PV installation sites in Northern Queensland.
